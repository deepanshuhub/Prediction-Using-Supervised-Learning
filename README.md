Prediction-Using-Supervised-Learning
This repository contains a predictive model that utilizes supervised learning techniques to estimate the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

<Description>
In the realm of education, it is essential to understand the relationship between study hours and academic performance. This project aims to address this by developing a supervised learning model that can predict a student's percentage based on the number of hours they dedicate to studying. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, this model can provide valuable insights into the potential outcomes of different study hour scenarios.

<Key Features>
.Utilizes a supervised learning approach to make predictions
.Takes the number of study hours as input to estimate the student's percentage
.Incorporates machine learning algorithms to learn from the provided data
.Provides a reliable estimation of academic performance based on study hours
.Offers valuable insights for educational institutions and students alike
